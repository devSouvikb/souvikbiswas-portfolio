        <h2>What is Version Control System?</h2>
        <p>
          A Version Control System (VCS) also known as Source Code Manager (SCM)
          is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time
          so that you can recall specific versions later. So ideally, we can
          place any file in the computer on version control.
        </p>
        <h2>So, what is Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files
          and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Git is a
          <strong>Distributed Version Control System</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It helps you keep track of the changes you make to your code. It is
          basically the history tab for your code editor. If at any point while
          coding you hit a fatal error and don’t know what’s causing it you can
          always revert back to the stable state. So it is very helpful for
          debugging. Or you can simply see what changes you made to your code
          over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using services like <strong>GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket</strong> etc
          multiple people and teams can easily collaborate among themselves on
          various projects and with help of <strong>Git</strong> can easily
          track all the changes along the code base.
        </p>
        <h2>Common terminologies to get familiar with</h2>
        <h3>Repository</h3>
        A repository aka repo is nothing but a collection of source code. It
        contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history
        with commits. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the
        repository. Repositories can be owned individually, or in a shared
        ownership with other people in an organization.
        <h3>Branch</h3>
        A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main
        working project, it is like <strong>branch of tree</strong>. It is an
        essential feature available in most modern version control systems. A
        Git project can have more than one branch. We can perform many
        operations on Git branch-like rename, list, delete, etc. The default
        branch in Git is the <strong>Master</strong> or the
        <strong> Main branch</strong>.
        <h3>Master</h3>
        Master or Main is a naming convention for Git branch. It's a default
        branch of Git. After cloning a project from a remote server, the
        resulting local repository contains only a single local branch. This
        branch is called a "master" branch. It means that "master" is a
        repository's "default" branch.
        <h3>Commit</h3>
        Every time you commit the state of your project in Git, it basically
        takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and
        stores a reference to that commit. All the changes from removing to
        adding code base all are noted via perticular commit.
        <h2>Some of the important Git commands</h2>
        <h3>git init</h3>
        <code>git init</code> is the git command by which we can create a new
        git repository from scratch. It is also used to initialize the existing
        project folder as a git repository.
        <h3>git add</h3>
        <code>git add</code> is a command used to add a file that is in the
        working directory to the staging area.
        <h3>git status</h3>
        <code>git status</code> is a command used to see what you have in the
        staging area and ready for commit, basically it will display the
        difference between "git add" and "git commit" command
        <h3>git commit</h3>
        <code>git commit</code> is a command used to add all files that are
        staged to the local repository.
        <h3>git push</h3>
        <code>git push</code> is a command used to push the local repository
        into the remote repository services such as GitHub, GitLab, etc.
        <h3>git pull</h3>
        <code>git pull</code> is a command used to pull the remote repository
        from services like GitHub, to the local working directory.
        <h3>git clone</h3>
        <code>git clone</code> is a command used to download and setup a remote
        repository into the local environment.
        <h3>git merge</h3>
        <code>git merge</code> is a command used to to get the files from the
        local repository into the working directory.
